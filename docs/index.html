            <p>Tietgen Festival is the annual festival at the Tietgen Residence Hall!
                The dorm houses 390 students from different educational backgrounds and nationalities.
                Once a year, all friends and neighbors of the dorm are invited into the circle to
                experience the Tietgen Spirit. The ambition is to create a festival where friends and
                neighbors can enjoy the dorm and its unique possibility for cultural mediation.</p>
            <p>The festival distinguishes itself from other festivals by being not
                just another party, but by being a festival which promotes curiosity, learning and
                cultural experiences alongside the great party! The festival is non-profit and is
                entirely run by volunteers from the dorm. All residents are invited to pitch in and help
                shape the festival from the festival vision.</p>
            <p><i><b>“The Annual Tietgen Festival strives to engage residents to come together in order to invite
                surrounding neighbors and fellow peers to demystify Tietgen, promote cultural curiosity and
                celebrate the Tietgen spirit.”</b></i></p>
